    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "    \n",
    "    Decision trees can be used to detect spam email from non-spam email; they are also used in customer service, where customers complete a series of questions/steps in order to narrow down the answers to frequency asked questions and so forth. This reduces the amount of time the company will have to have a human operator filter inbound questions and instead efficiently present answers using the decision tree. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Strenth & weaknesses:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Decision trees tend to be highly interpretable models: as a 'white-box' algorithm, it's easier, especially when compared to SVM or Neural Networks, to understand the top-down logic of the model and how it segments the data to classify categorical or continous values. A weakness, however, is that they tend to be unstable when presented new data; new data could drastically change the model and result in different boundaries for classification. \n",
    "      \n",
    "    Good candidate: Given that we're trying to classify two classes, based on a sequence of variables that can be defined and separable for different values (i.e., if the student-to-teacher ratio is below 3, then separate the tree into higher probability that it is a donor), decision trees are a great candidate for us to narrow down all the features that contribute to distinguishing between a donor and not a donor. \n",

    "    \n",
    "    SVMs are useful because they leverage the kernel trick: they are able to use nonlinear transformations to make the data linearly separable. As a result, SVMs are robust even when training samples have some bias. In addition, because the optimization problem is convex, SVMs guarantee a global minimum, whereas other algorithms such as neural networks, may converge at local minima and not be as robust over different samples. A major weakness, however, is that it is difficult to interpret the results. It is not a linear combination of features and relies on graphical visualization to better understand higher-dimensional SVMs. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Good candidate:\n",
    "    SVMs are a good candidate for our problem because we're using continous and categorical variables to classify two classes. Because it will provide a global minima, it can provide the highest performance relative to our other selected algorithsm with the given amount of data we have. \n",

    "    Strenth & weaknesses: Logistic regressions are simple, fast, and effective if the data is linearly separable across its feature space. It's strength is that it can be used as a benchmark from where we can continue to explore more complex algorithms. It's major weakenss is that we cannot solve non-linear problems with logistic regression. \n",
    "      \n",
    "    Good candidate: I believe it can be a good candidate because perhaps our data is simple enough to be linearly separable across its features. If it works, this will be faster than other more computationally intensive algorithms. It's also easy to implement. \n",

    "After evaluating the above graphs for a decision tree classifier (DTC), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR), I believe the logistic regression algorithm to be the best model for CharityML's application. When 100% of the training data is used, the DecisionTree model had the lowest F1-score relative to SVM and Logistic Regression. When we then compare the time it took SVM and Logistic Regression to train, we can clearly see the advantage of using the faster algorithm, which is our case is Logistic Regression. It took SVM nearly 120s and 20s to train and predict, respectively, while the time it took for LR was nearly instantaneous. \n",
    "\n",
    "LR, SVM, and Decision tree are all suitable algorithms for this binary classification problem. Given that LR outperforms in f1-score in the shortest amount of time, we have a clea winner. For CharityML, they want an algorithm that can quickly serve predictions with reliably high results when new data enters their database. LR will provide that flexibility./"

The model uses our data in an attempt to separate two distinct classes of people (donors or not donors) by drawing a line within our data after considering all the characteristics of a person. As we're training Logistic Regression, it counts the number of points it correctly and incorrectly determines to be a donor and attempts to correct itself when new data is presented. \n",

    "Logistic Regression makes a prediction by taking a new person's information (age, gender, wage, etc), which it hasn't seen before, and predicting, based on all the other times it has tried before, the best category (donor or non-donor) it should go in. Each time we ask it to make another prediction, and we give it another person's information that it hasn't seen before, it's going to reference all that it has learned from the previous information we gave it.

Generally, those who are of higher occupation (self-employed, doctor, lawyer, etc) should probably earn much more money. Those with capital_gains reported on their income tax indicate disposable income and investment savvyness, which would lead to a belief that they know how to manage their money and generate higher income. The third, workclass, is probably dependent on the previous two, but the workclass indicates where in the corporate structure they might be. Executives will more than likely have higher income than other typical workers. From there, I believe if hours-per-week reported to work are higher, then it is likely they are generating more income and thus help predictions. Lastly, I'll assume that older workers generally have more saved up, or more experience on the job, and thus earn more money. "

    "* How do these five features compare to the five features you discussed in **Question 6**?\n",
    "* If you were close to the same answer, how does this visualization confirm your thoughts? \n",

   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The five most important features, according to AdaBoost, are capital-gain, marital-status, education-num, age, and capital-loss. Relative to the 5-features I selected, I did not think marital-status, capital-loss, or education-num would be in the top-5 most important features. I was close, however, because I did consider capital-gain and age. This visualization confirms the idea that someone who is generating capital-gains is more and/or married, is more than 60% of the weight's importance for our algorithm predicting them to be donors or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are probably more relevant because capital-gain and capital-loss are closely tied together. If someone if typically investing, or earning a return on capital gains, it is also likely they had some losses (capital-losses), which still indicates that this individual is investing into passive-income generating assets. It also makes sense that being married means that the individual is earning more money as a household, and that typically being married is associated with an older age and higher level of income. Regarding education-num, it makes sense to correlate the number of years one spends studying with the amount of money they generate (in general). This, given that there are more than 40,000 samples, is probably true for a larger sample size even though it is not the only way individuals could earn more income (entrepreneurs, etc.). \n",

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
